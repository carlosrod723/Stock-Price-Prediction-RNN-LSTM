# Stock Price Prediction using RNN and LSTM

## Overview
Stock price prediction is a pivotal aspect of financial markets, with accurate forecasts offering critical insights for businesses, investors, and financial institutions. Accurate predictions enable investors to make informed decisions, helping them to identify opportunities for maximizing profits or minimizing losses. These forecasts allow for strategic capital allocation and dynamic portfolio adjustments based on predicted market movements.

The application of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning techniques has significantly enhanced the accuracy of stock price predictions. By leveraging advanced ML models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, financial analysts and traders can gain deeper insights into market trends, optimize investment strategies, and improve risk management in the highly complex and volatile landscape of stock markets.

Stock price prediction is inherently challenging due to the dynamic nature of financial markets, where traditional models often fail to capture intricate patterns and dependencies in the data. RNNs and LSTMs, however, excel in capturing temporal dependencies within time series data, making them particularly suited for forecasting tasks where past values influence future outcomes.

In this repository, the aim is to implement RNN and LSTM models specifically for predicting stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL). This implementation lays the groundwork for applying advanced deep learning techniques to financial forecasting. The focus is on understanding the architecture and functionality of RNNs and LSTMs, preprocessing historical stock price data, and effectively training and evaluating the models to achieve robust predictions.

This repository not only serves as a comprehensive guide to applying RNNs and LSTMs to stock price prediction but also provides a solid foundation for further exploration and implementation of these models in various financial forecasting scenarios.
